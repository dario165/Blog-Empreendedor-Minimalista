              <p class="blog-post-meta">
                January 1, 2021 by <a href="#">Dário Araújo</a>
              </p>

              <p>
               There are so many lessons I wish I had learned while I was young enough to appreciate and apply them. The thing with wisdom, and often with life lessons in general, is that they’ve learned in retrospect. Change comes slowly, incrementally over time; it’s only after looking back over a long period that we notice how much we’ve changed. The good news is that other people can benefit from our experiences and the lessons we’ve learned.
              </p>
              <h4> Here’re 10 important life lessons you should learn early on:</h4>
              
              <p>
              
             1. <strong>We must love.</strong> You know the saying, “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,”? I know, we often dismiss cliches with a wave of the hand, but maybe it’s a truth so profound we can discuss it only with aphorisms. Yes, we must love, even if it breaks our hearts—because, unless we love, our lives will flash by.
              </p>
              
                
                <p>
                 2. <strong>Only you can truly make yourself happy,</strong> maybe another aphorism, but It‘s not a person, place, job, or any other thing. Your perspective and perception of reality are everything. Happiness is a mindset. What happens to you is not as important as how you react to what happens.
                </p>
              
             
              
              <p>
               3.<strong>Happiness is not for sale.</strong>  We can’t buy happiness, yet we search the aisles, shelves, and items on Amazon in search of something more, of something to fill the void. The stuff won’t make us happy, though—not in the long run, anyway. At best, material things will temporarily pacify us. At worst, they will ruin our lives: they will leave us empty, they will leave us depressed, and with a big credit card debt.
              </p>
            
                  <p>
             4. <strong>Your Health Is Your Most Valuable Asset, </strong>Health is an invaluable treasure—always appreciate, nurture, and protect it. Good health is often wasted on the young before they have a chance to appreciate it for what it’s worth. We tend to take our good health for granted because it’s just there. We don’t have to worry about it, so we don’t really pay attention to it… until we have to.
              </p>

                  <p>
               5. <strong>Make change a must.</strong> For the longest time, I knew I wanted to change: unhappy, unsatisfied, and unfulfilled, I knew I didn’t have freedom—not real freedom. The problem was I knew this intellectually, but not emotionally: I didn’t have the feeling in my gut that things must change. A decision is not a real decision until it is done until you feel it on your nerve-endings until you take action. Once your shoulds have turned into musts, then you are ready for change. Changes normally come with a risk, just be brave to take it.
              </p>

                <p>
               6.<strong>Learn to listen to your gut instinct.</strong>  It’s often correct, this is one of the lessons I am happier that I learned soon.
              </p>
                  <p>
              7. <strong>It’s not all about you, </strong>You are not the epicenter of the universe. It’s very difficult to view the world from a perspective outside of your own since we are always so focused on what’s happening in our own lives. What do I have to do today? What will this mean for me, for my career, for my life? What do I want? It’s normal to be intensely aware of everything that’s going on in your own life, but you need to pay as much attention to what’s happening around you, and how things affect other people in the world as you do to your own life. It helps to keep things in perspective.
              </p>
                  <p>
               8. <strong>Awareness is the most precious freedom.</strong> Minimalism is a tool to rid ourselves of excess in favor of a better life: it is a tool to take a confused and convoluted world, cluttered with its endless embellishments, and make it simpler, easier. It is unimaginably hard to remain conscious, attentive, and aware in a society dominated by social media and fake happiness. It is difficult not to fall back into a trance-like state, surrounded by the trappings and obstructions of the tiring world around us—but it is crucial to do so, for this is real freedom.              </p>
                  <p>
               9. <strong>Don’t compare yourself to anyone.</strong> There is absolutely no point in comparing. Everyone’s life is on a different path. What’s right for them is not right for you. Don’t let society or anyone else (even if well-intentioned) dictate how to live your life. Do what you feel is best for you and you’ll save yourself a lot of heartache in the long run. It’s a great thing to be able to appreciate someone’s beauty or revel in someone else’s success knowing that it does not take away anything from yours. 
              </p>
                  <p>
                10. <strong>Don’t take anything or anyone for granted.</strong> We often don’t appreciate what we have until it’s gone: that includes your health, your family and friends, your job, the money you have or think you will have tomorrow. When you’re young, it seems that your parents will always be there, but they won’t. You think you have plenty of time to get back in touch with your old friends or spend time with new ones, but you don’t. You have the money to spend, or you think you’ll have it next month, but you might not. Nothing in your life is guaranteed to be there tomorrow, including those you love. This is a hard life lesson to learn, but it may be the most important of all. Make sure you appreciate what you have, while you still have it.
